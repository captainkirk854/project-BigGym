# Title: Ideas and Possibilities
- Category: **Blue Sky**

## Ideas
- Body weight tracking over time (based on PLAN type/objectives)
 - Data will be stored in **PROGRESS** table
- Selection of PLAN objective auto-selects the right exercises
 - to be based on actual user data
- **Auto calculate (from data in PROGRESS)**
 - BMI
   - from Weight (in **PROGRESS**) & Height (in **PERSON**)
   - = (Weight (kg)/Height (m))/Height (m)
 - Calorific intake
 - Ideal Weight projections
 - other things??
- Monetisation Opportunity
 - Depending on training objectives, can BigGym point to certain recommended products?
