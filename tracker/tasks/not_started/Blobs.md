# Title: Use of Blob Data Type
- Category: **Object Structure**
- Status: * **Not started** *

## Comments
- Optional Images/Video/etc could be associated with person, profile, exercises?
- Use of a single dedicated **BLOB** table
- Other tables (e.g. EXERCISE, PERSON) to have a suitable blobRefId or similar
- Alternatives
 - URL to web page
 - URI to local server filesystem for assets/resources
