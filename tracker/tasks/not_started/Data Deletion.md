# Title: Data Deletion
- Category: **Framework Stored Procedures and Functions**

- Status: * **Not started** *

## Comments
- need to decide if things actually get deleted or masked through a security view
- require a series of stored procedures although the ERD has been set up with referential integrity and cascading deletes.
